Prologue
--------

The muffled distant rumble which rolled over the grass hills didn't, at first, scare anyone. Least of all the ones right next to the first Rapture. The sheep were slowly grazing at the field and Boris was lazily chipping at the willow branch he had cut that morning. He was making a whistle again. He was trying to make a whistle only the dogs would hear, and wouldn't be too loud to his ears when he blew _reeeally_ hard into it. 


You see, his dogs were often far beyond from what the eye could see, over the rolling hills of the valley. He found a couple of abandoned herder pups in a nearby forest years ago. Mountain mutts, and by the looks of it, bred with wild wolves . As they often ran away after rabbits and pheasants but came back to help him herd the sheep in the evening, he wasn’t too concerned and spared him a pretty penny over the years. 


The rumble was getting louder now and Boris examined the fluffy, bright white clouds, interspersed across electrically blue sky. Nothing here looked like there was a storm approaching. However, the sheep were shuffling. Flicking their ears and nervously baaing, they were trying to stick together, as if something was approaching from all directions at once. Boris stood up. There was a wind picking up, and not a single dark cloud. His dogs were nowhere to be seen.


“Typical,” thought Boris. He wiped the few remaining chips away from his brand new dog whistle, brought it to his lips and blew hard. It was near silent, but not nearly high pitched to be a usable dog-whistle. He frowned. Surprisingly, his two dogs instantly showed up at the closest hilltop. They were running towards Boris, ignoring the trembling herd of the scared sheep. Full sprint, ears down, tails tucked invisible between their legs. Closing in, they skulked at him, nesting themselves around his ankles, whimpering at him for protection. 


Boris apprehensively looked at the whistle in his hand. He was getting really scared now. The rumble has now turning into deafening roaring which was coming from the sky and started to tremble the ground. The wind was picking up speed and carried high pitched noises of invisible mountains of metal. Thousands of tons of metal scraping against broken glass. Painfully close and nowhere to be seen, but the force of the noise knocked all air out of Boris’ lungs and hurt his bone marrow and he started wondering if he will pass out. 


“What was it.. The rule of threes? Three minutes without air?” he was asking himself desperately looking for a place to hide from the terrible noise which shook the ground and choked him.


The noise stopped and at once he felt every single hair on his body standing on its end. Despite the air quickly rushing back in his bruised lungs, his vision was getting blurry fast. The ground was still shaking. And even more violently, in random directions. In total silence. 


Trying to stabilize his eyes by looking at the calm sky, his eyes caught a wispy cracked line racing from the heavens. The infinite embroidered lighting reached the ground in a split second. The wind stopped, the sheep stood silent, and with the dogs trembling at his feet, Boris saw the sky split in two. With the thundering crack and terrible light, the impossible jagged split in the sky exploded. The shock wave scattered away the animals, leveled the trees, and knocked him unconscious.
