Collaborating on the novel
==========================================================
----------------------------------------------------------

I'm inviting anyone willing to help, suggest, comment or edit the text while it's being written

Why use Github to write a novel?
----------------------------------------------------------
It's not a first novel written on GitHub, but since GitHub is a _code repository_ it still might seem odd, especially to non-programmers. As a software engineer, I find git and other versioning systems indispensable in professional work. They make collaboration on complex codebases possible, and provide many other advantages. All of which can be applicable to many other works which may, or may not be collaborative, such as a book, for example ğŸ¤“ 

### Other reasons in no particular order ###


* it's simple to allow anyone access to comment and suggest edits
* typos and other fixes are easy to do with pull requests
* provides a backup alongside the local work-in-progress copy stored on my laptop
* accessible to anyone I would like to hear opinion from, shareable and public
* provides entire history of edits and possibility of undos all the way back to the start of the work
* possibility of forking the book, e.g. creating multiple alternate endings 
* weekly progress could be tagged as a release and then published as an episode
* the editors can easily be tracked and properly credited in the acknowledgements section
* GitHub's Issues tracker, Project manager and Wiki tools  
* using a GitHub for a non-programming project might help bring it to the more wide audience who can benefit from all the (FREE!) life-saving features of versioning systems such as git
